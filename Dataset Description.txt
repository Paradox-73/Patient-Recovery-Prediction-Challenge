Dataset Description
Description:
The Patient Recovery Dataset is designed to examine the factors influencing patient recovery outcomes. It contains 10,000 patient records, with each record including medical and lifestyle-related predictors, along with an overall Recovery Index.
The objective of this challenge is to build predictive models that can estimate a patient’s recovery progress based on their treatment and lifestyle factors.

Variables:
Therapy Hours: The total number of hours a patient spent in therapy sessions.
Initial Health Score: The patient’s health assessment score recorded during their first check-up.
Lifestyle Activities: Whether the patient engaged in additional healthy lifestyle activities (Yes or No).
Average Sleep Hours: The average number of hours the patient slept per day.
Follow-Up Sessions: The number of follow-up sessions the patient attended.
Target Variable:
Recovery Index: A measure of the overall recovery progress of each patient. The index ranges from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating better recovery outcomes. It has been rounded to the nearest integer.
