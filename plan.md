# Project Plan: Patient Recovery Prediction

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build a predictive model for patient recovery based on the provided dataset.

## 1. Data Understanding and Exploration (EDA)

*   **Objective:** Get familiar with the data and identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets using pandas.
    2.  Use `df.info()` and `df.describe()` to get a summary of the data (data types, non-null counts, statistics).
    3.  **Visualize Distributions:**
        *   Create histograms for numerical features (`Therapy Hours`, `Initial Health Score`, `Average Sleep Hours`, `Follow-Up Sessions`, `Recovery Index`).
        *   Create a count plot for the categorical feature (`Lifestyle Activities`).
    4.  **Analyze Relationships:**
        *   Create a correlation matrix with a heatmap to see the correlation between numerical features and the `Recovery Index`.
        *   Use box plots or violin plots to see the relationship between `Lifestyle Activities` and `Recovery Index`.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

*   **Objective:** Prepare the data for modeling.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Handle Categorical Variables:** Convert the `Lifestyle Activities` column from 'Yes'/'No' to 1/0.
    2.  **Check for Missing Values:** Use `df.isnull().sum()` to check for any missing data. If present, decide on an imputation strategy (e.g., mean, median).
    3.  **Feature Scaling:** Apply a scaling technique like `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` to the numerical features to bring them to a similar scale. This is important for models like Linear Regression and KNN.

## 3. Model Building and Training

*   **Objective:** Train various regression models to predict the `Recovery Index`.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Split the Data:** Split the `train.csv` data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% validation) to evaluate model performance locally.
    2.  **Train Models:** We will implement and train the following models:
        *   Linear Regression
        *   Decision Tree Regression
        *   Random Forest Regressor
        *   Gradient Boosting Regressor
        *   AdaBoost Regressor
        *   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
        *   Lasso (L1 Regularization)
        *   Ridge (L2 Regularization)

## 4. Model Evaluation

*   **Objective:** Compare the performance of the trained models.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Prediction:** Use the trained models to make predictions on the validation set.
    2.  **Metrics:** Evaluate the models using regression metrics such as:
        *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
        *   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
        *   **R-squared (RÂ²)**
    3.  **Comparison:** Create a table or a plot to compare the performance of all models and select the top-performing ones.

## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

*   **Objective:** Optimize the best-performing models to improve their accuracy.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Select Models:** Choose the top 2-3 models from the evaluation phase.
    2.  **Tuning:** Use techniques like `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the optimal hyperparameters for the selected models.

## 6. Final Model and Submission

*   **Objective:** Generate the final predictions for the test set.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Train Final Model:** Train the best, tuned model on the *entire* `train.csv` dataset.
    2.  **Predict on Test Data:** Make predictions on the `test.csv` data.
    3.  **Create Submission File:** Format the predictions into a `submission.csv` file with `id` and `Recovery Index` columns, as shown in `sample_submission.csv`.

## 7. Reporting

*   **Objective:** Document the entire process, from EDA to the final model.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Structure a report that includes:
        *   Introduction/Problem Statement
        *   Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
        *   Data Preprocessing steps
        *   Model descriptions and why they were chosen
        *   Model performance comparison
        *   Hyperparameter tuning results
        *   Conclusion and final model choice
        *   Kaggle leaderboard performance
